  <img src="start.png" class="pic" alt="How to get started with Coding">
  <p class="container">So are you new to the coding world? Ever wondered while playing a game like Assassin's Creed, what’s going on underneath the cool graphics and animation or got curious watching your friend doing cool stuffs with his/her PC by writing code language or if you have just stepped in the coding world by hearing an inspiring story about someone getting selected in <a class="link" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/"><i>Google Summer of Code</i></a> or Hackathons or <a class="link" href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam">Code Jam(s)</a> or if you are a non-CS/non-IT branch student and you are interested in Computers or Computer Science. Then you are at the right place! This blog contains all the bits and bytes of getting started with coding.</p>
  <div class="head"><h2>What is Programming?</h2></div>
  <img src="prog.png" class="pic" alt="What is Programming?">
  <p class="container">First of all, what is coding or as in general “programming”? Programming/coding is providing instructions to a computer to perform a certain task(s) or solve a problem in some programming language understandable by computers. We provide some input to the machine and an output is generated. Computers are low level (non-living) creatures that understand only Binary(language comprising 0’s and 1’s). We as a human know and understand high-level language(English, Hindi, Spanish,etc.)</p>
  <div class="head"><h2>How to interact with Computers?</h2></div>
  <img src="Code.png" class="pic" alt="Code">
  <p class="container">So, how do we interact with computers or how do we provide instructions that are understandable by a computer? That’s where programming languages come into pictures. Programming languages understand intermediate languages between high and low levels. But you might be wondering if the computers only understand Binary then how they are gonna understand intermediate-level language?</p>
  <p class="container">   Well, programming languages act as a translator between we humans and computers. A lot is going on underneath here too; conversion of intermediate-level language to machine code that is understandable by computers(Compilation) and then converting back the output to high level language so that humans can understand (Interpreter). But the good news is you don’t need to worry about how compilers work or how interpreters work if you are just getting started with coding because it’s a bit scary but if you are really interested to know more about them then Google it!.</p>
  <div class="container"><h2>Good thing about coding</h2></div>
  <img class="pic" src="Good.png" alt="Good News">
  <p class="container">You know what’s the good thing about coding? Anyone can learn coding!! It doesn’t require any prerequisite knowledge or you don’t need to belong to the IT/CS branch. Coding is open for everyone.</p>
  <div class="container"><h2>How to get started with programming?</h2></div>
  <img src="1.png" alt="How to get Started?" class="pic">
  <p class="container"> So the main question is “How do we get started with coding/programming?” Keep reading till the end and you’ll know it :-).</p>
  <p class="container">To be honest, when I, myself started coding I didn’t like it at all. Because the teacher in my college made the subject so boring that I started hating it. But I had to learn it cause it was in my course. So I tried to learn from the book but couldn’t understand much. I even tried Youtube but I didn’t find them interesting.</p>
  <p class="container">Then I reached out to one of my seniors in college and he suggested a course to me <a class="link" href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">CS50: Introduction to computer science</a>. This is an introductory course on Computer Science(programming) provided by <a class="link" href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> freely and taught by <a class="link" href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard’s</a> only <a class="link" href="https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/">David J. Malan</a>. And now I’m gonna suggest this course to you. It is the best “free” course you’ll ever find over the internet. The concepts are explained in real-time and you’ll just love the way <a class="link" href="https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/">David J. Malan</a> teaches. And to test your concepts they have problem sets specially designed for you by CS50’s team at <a class="link" href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a> and to be honest, some of the problems are tough. The problem sets contain real-world problems like looking for the person in the database with matching gene sequence(<a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STR_analysis">STR count</a>) or who will win an election by applying some algorithms or checking if the credit card used by you is valid or fake. </p>
  <p class="container"> It took me 2-3 days to solve almost more than 50% of the problems but even if you are not able to solve them in 2-3 days. <b>Don’t Give Up!</b> Go through the lecture and walkthrough again as many times you need but the most important thing is don't copy solutions from somewhere else and submit it. If you are gonna do that then coding is not your cup of tea. You’ll feel frustrated many times in starting because it’s said “The starting is the toughest” but you’ll get comfortable with time. Practicing is the key concept here. Practice until you get the hang of the concept. And eventually you’ll be able to solve it. The feeling after being able to run the code without any errors is amazing, trust me. And I’ll mention some of the really good practicing platforms at the end. After finishing the course there’s a reward for you. You’ll get <a class="link" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/certificate/">CS50x free certificate</a> too and all the code and sweat will pay off. And then you can show off your certificate on <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
  <img class="pic" src="Practice.png" alt="Practice">
  <p class="container">There’s another course freely available over the internet which is also really good. This course is provided by <a class="link" href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a> on <a class="link" href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a class="link" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java">Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose</a>. But it’s a bit different from the above-mentioned <a class="link" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x">CS50x</a> course. In this course, you’ll learn programming through <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> and <a class="link" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x">CS50x</a> course starts with <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> and goes through <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>. And by the way <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>, <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>, and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> are few of the 100’s of programming languages available out there in the world.</p>
  <p class="container">You can use <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> (<a class="link" href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MITOCW</a> has provided many series on programming)for learning if you are comfortable with that.
                        I’ll strongly recommend the <a class="link" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x">CS50x</a> course because according to me it's the best one out there for beginners. If you want to learn all languages <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>,
                        <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> i’ll recommend you first completing the <a class="link" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x">CS50x</a> course and then completing the  <a class="link" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java">Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose</a> course.
                        If you are confident that you can give time to both then do both courses side by side. If you don’t wanna study <a class="link" href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming">C language programming</a> and want to learn
                        <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> then you can take some other courses on <a class="link" href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> like <a class="link" href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Python for everybody</a> (I haven’t taken this course but the ratings are really good) or if you wanna
                        learn Java then go for <a class="link" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java">Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose</a> course. All of these courses have amazing content and problems. Solve them on your own.
                        You can take help with a friend or search about a concept on <a class="link" href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> but I strongly recommend not copying the solutions from <a class="link" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a class="link" href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack overflow</a>, or from somewhere else.</p>
